This Repository includes two files to test a script that finds and counts ERRORS in a log file.
The script is written in Python and uses the `argparse` library to handle command-line arguments. 
It reads a log file, counts the occurrences of the word "ERROR", and prints the count to the console.


Error log created using chat GPT using the next command: "Can you create a log that includes 7 "ERROR:" lines so I can use it for testing"
